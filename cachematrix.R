## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 

## Below are the functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.



## Function1: makeCacheMatrix:
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) 
{
        invmat <- NULL
        set <- function(y) 
		{
                x <<- y
                invmat <<- NULL
        	}
        get <- function() x

        setinverse <- function(inverse) invmat <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() invmat

        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}



## Function2: cacheSolve:
## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
## makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) 
{
        invmat <- x$getinverse()
        if (!is.null(invmat)) 
		{
                message("getting cached data")
                return(invmat)
       	}

        data <- x$get()
        invmat <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(invmat)
        invmat
        ## invmat Returns a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
